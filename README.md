# Ruler üìè

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/batmanscode/ruler/main/ruler.py)

This web app uses machine learning to generate product recommendations ([association rule learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning)) from an input CSV.

The input CSV needs the following input columns:

* Unique transaction ID (like an invoice number)
* Item name

Demo data used is a variation of: [Online Retail Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)
